# Skin Cancer Type Detection System

## Overview
The skin cancer detection system now includes comprehensive cancer type classification, identifying specific types of skin cancer and providing detailed information about each type.

## 🎯 **Detected Cancer Types**

### 1. **Melanoma** ⚠️
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Urgency**: IMMEDIATE
- **Description**: The most dangerous form of skin cancer
- **Characteristics**: Asymmetrical shape, irregular borders, multiple colors, large diameter (>6mm), evolving appearance
- **Treatment**: Surgical removal, immunotherapy, targeted therapy
- **Survival Rate**: 95% if caught early

### 2. **Basal Cell Carcinoma** 🟡
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Urgency**: MODERATE
- **Description**: Most common and least dangerous skin cancer
- **Characteristics**: Pearl-like bump, pink or red color, shiny appearance, slow growing, may bleed or crust
- **Treatment**: Surgical removal, topical treatments
- **Survival Rate**: 99% with treatment

### 3. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma** 🟠
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Urgency**: MODERATE
- **Description**: Second most common skin cancer
- **Characteristics**: Rough, scaly patch, red or pink color, may be tender, can grow quickly, may ulcerate
- **Treatment**: Surgical removal, radiation therapy
- **Survival Rate**: 95% with early treatment

### 4. **Actinic Keratosis** 🟣
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Urgency**: LOW
- **Description**: Precancerous lesion that may develop into SCC
- **Characteristics**: Rough, scaly patches, pink/red/brown color, small size (<1cm), may be tender, sun-exposed areas
- **Treatment**: Topical treatments, cryotherapy
- **Survival Rate**: 100% with treatment

### 5. **Seborrheic Keratosis** ✅
- **Risk Level**: NONE
- **Urgency**: NONE
- **Description**: Benign (non-cancerous) skin growth
- **Characteristics**: Waxy appearance, stuck-on look, brown or black color, rough texture, common in older adults
- **Treatment**: No treatment needed, cosmetic removal if desired
- **Survival Rate**: 100% (benign)

### 6. **Benign Mole** ✅
- **Risk Level**: NONE
- **Urgency**: NONE
- **Description**: Normal, non-cancerous mole
- **Characteristics**: Round or oval shape, even color, smooth borders, small size (<6mm), stable appearance
- **Treatment**: No treatment needed
- **Survival Rate**: 100% (benign)

## 🔬 **Detection Algorithm**

The system uses an advanced AI simulation that analyzes multiple factors:

### **Analysis Factors:**
1. **Image Characteristics**: Size, quality, aspect ratio
2. **Filename Patterns**: Keywords like 'mole', 'lesion', 'suspicious'
3. **Color Analysis**: Darker lesions may indicate higher risk
4. **Texture Analysis**: Rough or irregular textures
5. **Border Irregularity**: Asymmetrical or jagged borders
6. **Risk Score Calculation**: Weighted combination of all factors

### **Classification Logic:**
- **High Risk (>0.8)**: Likely Melanoma
- **Medium-High Risk (0.6-0.8)**: Melanoma or Squamous Cell Carcinoma
- **Medium Risk (0.4-0.6)**: Basal Cell Carcinoma or Squamous Cell Carcinoma
- **Low-Medium Risk (0.2-0.4)**: Actinic Keratosis
- **Low Risk (0.1-0.2)**: Seborrheic Keratosis
- **Very Low Risk (<0.1)**: Benign Mole

## 🎨 **User Interface Features**

### **Dashboard Display:**
- **Cancer Type Card**: Shows detected type with icon and color coding
- **Confidence Level**: Displays detection confidence percentage
- **Key Characteristics**: Lists identifying features
- **Risk Assessment**: Shows risk level and urgency
- **Treatment Information**: Provides treatment options
- **Survival Rate**: Shows prognosis information

### **History Integration:**
- **Cancer Type Filtering**: Filter history by specific cancer types
- **Search Functionality**: Search by cancer type name
- **Detailed View**: Expandable cards with full cancer type information
- **Confidence Tracking**: Track detection confidence over time

## 📊 **Data Storage**

Each analysis result now includes:
```javascript
{
  id: "timestamp",
  filename: "image.jpg",
  result: "Malignant (Confidence: 85%)",
  confidence: 85,
  cancerType: "MELANOMA",
  cancerTypeName: "Melanoma",
  cancerTypeConfidence: 88,
  timestamp: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```
